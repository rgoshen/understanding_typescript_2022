### What is TypeScript & Why Should You Use It?

[transcript](/assets/transcripts/1.01.what_is_typescript_and_why_should_you_use_it.txt)

What is TypeScript?

- JavaScript superset[^1]
- makes JavaScript code easier and more powerful
- one huge disadvantage
  - cannot be executed by JavaScript environments like the browser

What's the idea behind TypeScript then?

- TypeScript is a programming language, but it's also a tool
  - powerful compiler which you run over your code to compile your TypeScript code to JavaScript code
  - the compiler compiles these new features to JavaScript workarounds
- TypeScript does one important thing: it adds types
  - actually gives the developer an opportunity of identifying errors in the code earlier before your script runs and the errors at runtime in the browser
